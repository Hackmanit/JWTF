                <h2>General Notice and Mandatory Information</h2>
                <p><strong>Announcement of the Responsible Party</strong></p>
                <p>The responsible party for the data processing on this website is:</p>
                <p>Hackmanit GmbH<br> Contact person: Prof. Dr. Marcus Niemietz<br> Universitätsstraße 60
                    (Exzenterhaus)<br>
                    44789 Bochum, Germany</p>
                <p>The responsible party decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing
                    personal
                    data (e.g. names, contact details, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></p>
                <p>Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. A revocation of your
                    already
                    given consent is possible at any time. An informal notification by e-mail is sufficient for the
                    revocation.
                    The legitimacy of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
                    revocation.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Right of Complaint to the Responsible Supervisory Authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</strong></p>
                <p>In the event of a violation of data protection law, you have the right to file a complaint with the
                    responsible supervisory authority. The responsible supervisory authority with regard to data
                    protection issues
                    is the data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is located.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to data transferability (Art. 20 GDPR)</strong></p>
                <p>You have the right to request that data which we process automatically on the basis of your consent
                    or in
                    fulfillment of a contract be handed over to yourself or to third parties. The information is
                    provided in a
                    machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible
                    party, this
                    will only take place if it is technically possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion (Art. 15-17 GDPR)</strong></p>
                <p>You have the right to access information about your stored personal data, the origin of the data, its
                    recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, the right to correction,
                    blocking or
                    deletion of this data at any time within the framework of the applicable legal regulations without
                    any costs.
                    In this regard and also for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at
                    any time
                    via the contact options listed in the imprint.</p>
                <p><strong>SSL/TLS Encryption</strong></p>
                <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as
                    the site
                    operator, our website uses SSL/TLS encryption. This means that data that you transmit via this
                    website cannot
                    be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https://" address line
                    of your
                    browser and by the lock symbol in the browser line.</p>
                <p><strong>Server Log Files</strong></p>
                <p>In server log files, the provider of the website automatically collects and stores information that
                    your
                    browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                    <li>Operating system in use</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL</li>
                    <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
                    <li>Time of the request to the server</li>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These data are not merged with other data sources. The data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1
                    lit. b
                    GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual
                    measures. This
                    data will be evaluated and subsequently discarded solely to ensure the smooth operation of the site
                    in terms
                    of stability and security and to improve our services.</p>
                <p><strong>Newsletter</strong></p>
                <p>If you wish to receive the newsletter provided on this website, we require an e-mail address from you
                    as well
                    as information that allows us to verify that you agree with the owner of the e-mail address provided
                    and with
                    the receipt of the newsletter.</p>
                <p>We use the so-called double opt-in process to ensure that the newsletter is sent with explicit
                    consent. In
                    the course of this, the potential recipient is included in a mailing list. Subsequently, the user
                    receives a
                    confirmation e-mail to confirm the registration in a legally secure manner. Only if this
                    confirmation is given
                    will the address be actively added to the mailing list.</p>
                <p>We use these data only for the dispatch of the requested information and offers.</p>

                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <p><strong>Liability for content:</strong><br>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
                    content on
                    these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG,
                    however, we
                    are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or
                    to
                    investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
                    information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
                    possible from
                    the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of any such infringement, we
                    will remove
                    such content immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>Liability for links:</strong> <br>Our offer contains links to external websites of third
                    parties, on
                    whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external
                    contents.
                    The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked
                    pages.
                    The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
                    were not
                    recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked
                    pages is not
                    reasonable without specific indications of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any
                    infringements, we
