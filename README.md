# JSON Web Token Forgery (JWTF)
JWTF has two main purposes:
1. Allow to manually decode, analyze, and alter JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
2. Automatically generate manipulated JWTs to be used in penetration tests, security audits, bug bounty hunting, and CTFs.

JWTF was developed by [Hackmanit](https://hackmanit.de) and [Niklas Conrad](https://www.github.com/conni404).

JWTF supports all well-known attacks against the validation of JWTs and automatically applies these attack vectors to a given JWT. As an output it generates a text file with all manipulated tokens. This text file can then be used in semi-automated tests, for example using the "Intruder" feature of [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro).

This eases the process of testing an implementation for vulnerabilities in its JWT validation logic.
